# :question: What is this project
 This is c library written by me that contains bunch of core c funcitons. I did this when i was in globally known 42 software schools 

 # :question: Which language and libraries used for this project
 This project developed using C language and makefile.

 # :video_game: About library
 If you manage the enter the globally known software school named 42 schools, this is the first task you need to complete. You need to write 42 core C language functions. This is very educational and challenging task to complete, yet so rewardful. Here is the full list of functions this library contains

 # :sparkles: What i learned from this
 I learned very useful c functions, not learning also how did they written. Because this was developed in the 42 school envirorment, i have found a cahnce to meet awesome people who they passed this roads. It was truly a educational experience
